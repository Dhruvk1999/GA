Explanation of each directory and file:

    data/: This directory is for storing historical price and volume data. You might have a script (fetch_data.py) to download or fetch the data from a source.

    strategies/: This directory contains modules related to strategies. alphas.py could have implementations of various alpha factors, optimization.py might contain the genetic algorithm optimization code, and signals.py could have functions for generating trading signals.

    utils/: The data_utils.py module contains utility functions for handling data, and ga_utils.py could contain utility functions for the genetic algorithm.

    main.py: This script ties everything together. It loads the data, applies alphas, runs the genetic algorithm, and generates trading signals.

    requirements.txt: A file listing all project dependencies. You can generate this file using pip freeze > requirements.txt after installing your dependencies.

    config.yaml: A configuration file for project settings. You can store parameters like genetic algorithm parameters, data file paths, etc., in this file for easy modification.
